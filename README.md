## About The Milwaukee Bitcoin Meetup

**Open Forum with Guided Moderation** 

The meetimg format is such that anyone can speak, but a moderator will be present to help guide  discussion. We hope that all voices are heard and the conversation stays on track.

**Themed Discussions with Expert Insights** 

Meetings are organized around specific themes (e.g., Bitcoin technology, investment strategies, regulatory environment, saftey, security, economics and news). Occasionally, we invite experts to provide deeper insights in order to stimulate informed and diverse opinions.

**We Encourage Respectful Debate** 

We try to create an environment where differing opinions are not just allowed, but they are encouraged. At each event, participants are reminded to respect differing viewpoints and to debate ideas, not attack people.

**Flexible Attribution Rules Apply** 

The group encourage participants to share information freely but we suggest that members respect the privacy and intellectual contributions of others. For instance, we want you to share the ideas you've learned, but we ask thst participants ask the speaker for consent before attributing specific comments or strategies to a particular individual speaker.

**Fosting Actionable Takeaways** 

We encourage discussions to be grounded in practicality. for example, some sessions are dedicated to how Bitcoin can be practically incorporated into our daily lives, our investment portfolios, or our business practices.

**Documentation and Follow-up** 

The group strives to provide summaries of key points from each meeting (while respecting the attribution preferences of each individual participant or speaker) to be distribute to members after each meetup. we do this so that the valuable resources discussed can be accessible for those who want to share insights with others or revisit them later.

**Networking** 

At the meetings, there is plenty of time for networking and informal discussions that give members a chance to discuss personal experiences or ask specific questions in smaller groups.

**Feedback** 

We hope to regularly get feedback from participants of the meetings to ensures the group evolves according to the members' interests and needs.

We feel this approach balances the need for open, diverse discussions with the practicalities of sharing and applying knowledge. We hope the meeting style, format and guidelines respects individual contributions while fostering a collaborative environment conducive to learning and action.

## Disclaimer 
 
**Note:** While this GutHub repo is a hard fork of another meetup group's repo as a convenient starting point, this group is NOT a hard fork of any particular CURRENT 2024 "Milwaukee Bitcoin Meetup". 

There WAS an older "Bitcoin Milwaukee" back in 2021 that had derailed due to a rouge Telegram admin. **Our** group hard-forked from that one on Telegram in 2021 in an effort to preserve historical data.
